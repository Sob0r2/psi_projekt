# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

My project is to create an efficient model that can predict whether a Twitter/X game review is negative, positive or neutral. The model is really simple but performs well. When I was working on the model, I focused on text preprocessing and not on achieving the best possible accuracy by choosing the most complex model. You can use this model with a review as a string or as a Dataframe with more than one review. You can also provide a thread from which your message is in an additional column called 'game'.
